    "text": "1.2 What can I do in a Quarto Wiki?\nA Quarto Wiki is a powerful tool that you can use to enhance your project‚Äôs documentation and collaboration. Here are some of the key features and actions you can perform in a Quarto Wiki:\n\n1.2.1 Create and Organize Pages\n\nCreate Pages: You can create multiple pages to document different aspects of your project, such as installation guides, API documentation, tutorials, and FAQs.\nOrganize Pages: Arrange pages in a hierarchical structure with nested pages, or use a table of contents to provide easy navigation.\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Write and Format Content\n\nMarkdown Support: Quarto Wikis support Markdown, allowing you to format text with headers, lists, links, images, code blocks, and more.\nHTML Support: For more advanced formatting, you can also use HTML.\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Collaborate with Others\n\nEdit Pages: Multiple collaborators can edit wiki pages to contribute to the documentation.\nHistory and Versioning: Track changes made to the wiki pages, view revision history, and revert to previous versions if necessary.\n\n\n\n1.2.4 Embed Media and Code\n\nImages and Videos: Embed images and videos to enhance the documentation visually.\nCode Snippets: Include code snippets with syntax highlighting for various programming languages.\n\n\n\n1.2.5 Link to Other Resources\n\nInternal Links: Link to other pages within the wiki for better navigation.\nExternal Links: Link to external resources such as websites, other repositories, or documentation.\n\n\n\n1.2.6 Search and Navigation\n\nSearch: Use the search functionality to find specific content within the wiki quickly.\nSidebar and Footer: Customize the sidebar and footer to provide links to important pages and resources.\n\n\n\n1.2.7 Access Control\n\nPublic and Private Wikis: Depending on the repository settings, the wiki can be public for anyone to view or private, accessible only to repository collaborators.\nPermissions: Control who can edit the wiki pages by managing repository permissions.\n\n\n\n1.2.8 Git Integration\n\nClone and Push: Clone the wiki repository to your local machine, make changes locally, and push updates back to GitHub. This allows for more advanced editing using local tools and version control.\n\n\n\n1.2.9 Templates and Examples\n\nTemplates: Use templates to standardize the structure and format of your documentation pages.\nExamples: Provide examples and use cases to help users understand how to use your project effectively.\n\n\n\n1.2.10 Project Management\n\nDocumentation for Projects: Use the wiki to document the project‚Äôs development process, including roadmaps, milestones, and task lists.",
