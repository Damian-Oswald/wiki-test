    "text": "1.2 What can I do in a Quarto Wiki?\nA Quarto Wiki is a powerful tool that you can use to enhance your project‚Äôs documentation and collaboration. Here are some of the key features and actions you can perform in a Quarto Wiki:\n\nCreate and Organize Pages: You can create multiple pages to document different aspects of your project, such as installation guides, API documentation, tutorials, and FAQs. Arrange pages in a hierarchical structure with nested pages, or use a table of contents to provide easy navigation.\nWrite and Format Content: Quarto Wikis support Markdown, allowing you to format text with headers, lists, links, images, code blocks, and more. For more advanced formatting, you can also use HTML.\nCollaborate with Others: Multiple collaborators can edit wiki pages to contribute to the documentation. Track changes made to the wiki pages, view revision history, and revert to previous versions if necessary.\nEmbed Media and Code: Embed images and videos to enhance the documentation visually. Include code snippets with syntax highlighting for various programming languages.\nLink to Other Resources: Internal Links: Link to other pages within the wiki for better navigation. External Links: Link to external resources such as websites, other repositories, or documentation.\nSearch and Navigation: Use the search functionality to find specific content within the wiki quickly. Customize the sidebar and footer to provide links to important pages and resources.\nAccess Control: Public and Private Wikis: Depending on the repository settings, the wiki can be public for anyone to view or private, accessible only to repository collaborators. Permissions: Control who can edit the wiki pages by managing repository permissions.\nGit Integration: Clone and Push: Clone the wiki repository to your local machine, make changes locally, and push updates back to GitHub. This allows for more advanced editing using local tools and version control.\nProject Management: Documentation for Projects: Use the wiki to document the project‚Äôs development process, including roadmaps, milestones, and task lists."
